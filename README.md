# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

I'm Rensyl, and I' m a Filipino Computer Science student from Batangas State University PB Main II, and this is my new repository.
 Though in the start of my school days, I have no idea and at the same time,
practical experience on programming but then as time goes by, I've learned a lot from various references to build my programming skills.
On our First Semester, we use the programming language C++, as our platform to learn on how to code, and we had our first software demonstration
as our final requirement for our First Semester. After that, C++ is no longer our platform because the administration of our department
decides to give CS students a new programming language, and that was Python :)

Currently, I'm finishing my Second Semester as a freshmen student. And I really really love Python because of its huge community and more 
friendly syntax. I also learning other programming languages like R, JavaScript, Ruby, Swift, and some other databases like SQL.

But my overall platform is Python!

# hello-world

Hi Everyone!

I'm Rensyl, A Filipino Computer Science freshmen, and this is my new repository.
During the first day of school, I have no idea or any
practical experience on programming but then as time passed, I've learned a lot from various references to build my programming skills.
On our First Semester, we use the C++ as our first programming language, and we had our first software demonstration
as our final requirement. After C++, we use Python on our Second Semester including the summer class and discuss about
the different types of data structures and algorithm. Then we have the same programming language on the First Semester as a Second Year
College and discuss one of the major application of programming, the OOP. Then  finally, on the Second Semester of the school year,
we use the Java language on our Advanced Object-Oriented Programming. 

But my overall platform is Python!
